;; Exercise 1.24
;; For this exercise, we've redefined the `prime?` procedure with a new name,
;;   to allow us to interchange definitions of the `prime?` procedure with
;;   other prime tests, for example `fast-prime`.

;; I can't get the timing to work now that I'm using gnu-scheme. The time
;; is measured in ticks, which are much slower than the time it takes for
;; these processes to complete. Because of this, I've left this exercise
;; unfinished.
