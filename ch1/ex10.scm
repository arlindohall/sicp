;; Doing some research on the Ackermann function, it seems that it computes a
;; meta-multiplication by `2`. That is, 

#|
`(A 0 n)` $ = 2*n $, which is `f`
`(A 1 n)` $ = 2*2$ n times $ = 2^n $, which if `g`
`(A 2 n)` $ = 2^{{2^2}^{...}} $ n times, which we'll call: $ h(n) $, and which is `h` from the example
`(A 3 n)` $ = h(h(...h(1))) $ n times

Going off of this, we expect `(A 3 3)` to be $ h(h(h(1))) $, which would give us
$$ = h(h(2)) $$
$$ = h(2^2) $$
$$ = h(4) $$
$$ = 2^{2^{2^{2}}} $$
$$ = 65536 $$
... clearly this method of computation will get out of hand very quickly with increasing values of `x`.
