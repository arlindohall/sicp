Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
=================================================

This project consists of the worked example questions in the MIT
introductory programming text
[SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), which I
am using to learn Scheme.

I'm not including full answers to the question that are purely
text-based, for example the questions that ask you to expand a program
fully as lines of text or as a tree. These I will give a brief answer
to, showing the beginning of the solution, but I won't work out
completely, and so if there is a question along the lines of "how many
steps are in this execution" then I'll just move on, since my focus is
on getting the code written.

Corrections
-----------

Please feel free to make a pull request or issue for any problems you
see in my code. The goal is to have a working jupyter notebook with the
whole book worked out correctly. Even though this is a problem solving
exercise for me, I'm glad to have any feedback to reach the main goal.
