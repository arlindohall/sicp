# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This project consists of the worked example questions in the MIT introductory programming text [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), which I am using to learn Scheme.

Where possible, I will provide both example code and a sentence or two explaining my thought process. My aim is to include example code even when the "solution" to the question does not explicitly call for it, so that I can fully utilize the Jupyter functionality, which I am also new to.

## Corrections

Please feel free to make a pull request or issue for any problems you see in my code. The goal is to have a working jupyter notebook with the whole book worked out correctly. Even though this is a problem solving exercise for me, I'm glad to have any feedback to reach the main goal.
